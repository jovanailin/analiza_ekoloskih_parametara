# Analysis of Ecological Data

## Project Overview
This project is designed to explore and analyze ecological data using statistical methods and graphical representations. This R Markdown project focuses on the application of descriptive statistics, General Linear Models (GLM), Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and Label Propagation (LP) to provide insights into environmental studies.

## Repository Structure
- **Analiza_Ekoloskih_Parametara.Rmd**: Main R Markdown file containing all the code and documentation.
- **data/**: Directory containing datasets used in the analyses.
- **figures/**: Directory where generated plots and figures are stored.

## How to Use
To use this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Analiza_Ekoloskih_Parametara.Rmd` file in RStudio.
3. Install required R packages using `install.packages("package_name")`.
4. Run the R Markdown file to perform the analyses and generate the report.

## Technologies
- **R**: The project is developed in R, utilizing various packages such as `ggplot2` for plotting, `vegan` for ecological analyses, and `lpSolve` for linear programming.
- **R Markdown**: Used for integrating the analysis code with its documentation, making it easy to follow the workflow and results.
